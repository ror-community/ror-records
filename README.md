# Prepare JSON files in ror-updates

## Create JSON files for new and updated ROR records
JSON files for new and updated ROR records are created by the ROR metadata curation lead and curation advisory board as part of the process managed in [ror-updates](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates). **Only changes requested and approved through this curation process are included in ROR data releases.**

Schema-valid ROR record JSON can be generated from a CSV using the [ROR API /bulkupdate endpoint](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-api?tab=readme-ov-file#createupdate-multiple-record-files-from-a-csv). Note that relationships should not be included in record files; these are created in the [Generate relationships](#generate-relationships) step of the deployment process.

Once created, push JSON files to ror-updates in a new branch per below.

### Create new release branch in ror-updates
These steps assume that you have already [installed and configured git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your computer, and that you have cloned the [ror-updates](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates) repository locally.

1. In your local ror-updates directory, checkout the Main branch

        git checkout main

2. Make sure your local Main branch matches the remote branch (make sure to git stash any local changes before doing this!)

        git fetch origin
        git reset --hard origin/main

3. Checkout a new branch based on Main. Branch name does not need to match the ror-records release branch naming convention, but should clearly convey the release number.

        git checkout -b rc-v1.3-review

### Push record files to release branch in ror-updates
1. Create in new directory in the root of the ror-updates repository with the **exact same name** as the branch (ex: rc-v1.3-review).

        mkdir rc-v1.3-review

2. Create subdirectories ```new``` and ```updates``` inside the directory you just created.
*Note: Creating both directories is not required in order for validation and relationship generation actions to work. If there are only new records or only updates, you only need to create one directory. If there's no ```updates``` directory but the relatinships.csv file contains relationships to production records, the relationship generation action will create an ```updates``` directory and download production records into it.*

        mkdir rc-v1.3-review/new
        mkdir rc-v1.3-review/updates

3. Place the JSON files for new and updated records inside the directories you just created.
4. Add and commit the files

        git add rc-v1.3-review/
        git commit -m "add new and updated ROR records to rc-v1.3-review"

5. Push the files and new branch to the remote ror-records repository

        git push origin rc-v1.3-review

6. Repeat steps 1-3 if additional files need to be added to the release candidate.

## Validate files in ror-updates
JSON files for new and updated ROR records should be validated before generating relationshps to check that they comply with the ROR schema and contained properly formatted JSON. Validation is performed by a script [run_validations.py](https://github.com/ror-community/validation-suite/blob/main/run_validations.py) triggered by a Github action [Validate files](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/actions/workflows/validate.yml
).

1. Go to https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/actions/workflows/validate.yml (Actions > Create relationships in the ror-updates repository)
2. Click Run workflow at right and set the following options:
    - **Use workflow from:** Branch rc-vX.X
    - **Schema version:** v2
    - **Check box to skip Geonames validation:** Checked
    - **Check box to validate relationships:** Unchecked
    - **Name of parent directory:** Blank, unless files are located in a directory with a different name from the release branch name
3. Click the green Run workflow button. Success/error status will be shown in Github actions and posted to the #ror-curation-releases Slack channel.
4. If this workflow fails, there's an issue with the data in one of more ROR record JSON files that needs to be corrected. In that case, check the error details, make the needed corrections, commit and push the files to your working branch and repeat steps 1-3 to re-run the Validate files workflow.

## Generate relationships
Relationships are not included in the intitial ROR record JSON files. Relationships are generated using a script [generaterelationships.py](https://github.com/ror-community/curation_ops/blob/main/generate_relationships/generate_relationships.py) triggered by a Github action [Create relationships](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/actions/workflows/generate_relationships.yml), which should be run AFTER all new and updated JSON records to be included in the release are uploaded to ror-updates.


1. Create relationships list as a CSV file using the template [[TEMPLATE] relationships.csv](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17rA549Q6Vc-YyH8WUtXUOvsAROwCDmt1vy4Rjce-ELs) and name the file relationships.csv. **IMPORTANT! File must be named relationships.csv and fields used by the script must be formatted correctly**. Template fields used by the script are:

| **Field name**                          | **Description**                                                                             | **Example value**                               |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Record ID                               | ROR ID of record being added/updated, in URL form                                           | https://ror.org/015m7w34                        |
| Related ID                              | ROR ID of the related record, in URL form                                                   | https://ror.org/02baj6743                       |
| Relationship of Related ID to Record ID | One the following values: Parent, Child, Related, Delete (case insensitive)                                             | Parent                                         |
| Name of org in Related ID               | Name of the related organization, as it appears in the name field of the related ROR record | Indiana University â€“ Purdue University Columbus |
| Current location of Related ID          | Production or Release branch (not required for Delete relationship)                                                             | Production                                      |

*Note: Relationships can be deleted by specifying the 2 records in Record ID and Related ID and "Delete" in Relationship of Related ID to Record ID. All relationships between the 2 records will be deleted from both records. It does not matter which record is in Record ID and which is in Related ID, and neither record needs to be in the release. Records will be downloaded if needed.*

2. Place the relationships.csv inside the parent directory where the ROR record JSON files are located (ex: rc-v1.3-review - don't put it inside new or updates directories).
3. Commit and push the relationships.csv file to your working branch, ex:

        git add rc-v1.3-review/relationships.csv
        git commit -m "adding relationships list to v1.3"
        git push origin rc-v1.3-review

4. Go to https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/actions/workflows/generate_relationships.yml (Actions > Create relationships in the ror-updates repository)
5. Click Run workflow at right and set the following options:
    - **Use workflow from:** Branch rc-vX.X
    - **Schema version:** v2
    - **Name of parent directory:** Blank, unless files are located in a directory with a different name from the release branch name

6. Click the green Run workflow button. Success/error status will be shown in Github actions and posted to the #ror-curation-releases Slack channel.
7. If this workflow fails, there's likely a mistake in the relationships.csv or one or more of the ROR record JSON files that needs to be corrected. In that case, make the needed corrections, commit and push the files to the rc-vX.X branch and repeat steps 3-5 to re-run the Create relationships workflow.

## Remove relationships to inactive records
Active records cannot contain relationships to inactive or withdrawn records. On each release, all release records must be checked for status changes and, for any where status changed from active to inactive or withdrawn, relationships to those records must be removed from active records (both in the release and in production).

Relationships to inactive records are removed using a script [remove_relationships.py](https://github.com/ror-community/curation_ops/blob/main/remove_relationships/remove_relationships.py) triggered by a Github action [Remove relationships to inactive records](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/actions/workflows/remove_relationships.yml), which must be run AFTER the Generate relationships action.


1. Go to https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/actions/workflows/remove_relationships.yml (Actions > Remove relationships to inactive records in the ror-updates repository)
2. Click Run workflow at right, choose the schema version and the rc-vX.X branch, and click the green Run workflow button. If the directory containing the files you'd like to validate has a different name from the branch you're working on, enter name of that directory.
3. Click the green Run workflow button. Success/error status will be shown in Github actions and posted to the #ror-curation-releases Slack channel.

## Update labels in relationships
When the ROR display name changes in a release record, relationship labels must be updated in any related records. Records are checked for ROR display name changes and relationship labels in related records are updated using a script [update_related.py](https://github.com/ror-community/curation_ops/blob/main/update_related_records/update_related.py) triggered by a Github action [Update labels in relationships](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/actions/workflows/update_labels.yml), which must be run AFTER the Remove relationships to inactive records action.

1. Go to https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/actions/workflows/update_labels.yml (Actions > Update labels in related records in the ror-updates repository)
2. Click Run workflow at right and set the following options:
    - **Use workflow from:** Branch rc-vX.X
    - **Schema version:** v2
    - **Name of parent directory:** Blank, unless files are located in a directory with a different name from the release branch name

3. Click the green Run workflow button. Success/error status will be shown in Github actions and posted to the #ror-curation-releases Slack channel.

## Update locations
All release records must have their locations.geonames_details checked against the Geonames API and updated with the latest Geonames data if any differences exist. Locations are updated using a script [update_addresses.py](https://github.com/ror-community/curation_ops/blob/main/update_address_only/update_addresses.py) triggered by a Github action [Update addresses](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/actions/workflows/update_addresses.yml). This action should be run after all changes to release files are complete, except last modified date updates.

1. Go to https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/actions/workflows/update_addresses.yml (Actions > Update addresses in the ror-updates repository)
2. Click Run workflow at right and set the following options:
    - **Use workflow from:** Branch rc-vX.X
    - **Schema version:** v2
    - **Name of parent directory:** Blank, unless files are located in a directory with a different name from the release branch name

3. Click the green Run workflow button. Success/error status will be shown in Github actions and posted to the #ror-curation-releases Slack channel.

## Update last modified dates
All release records must have their last modified date updated to match the (planned) date of the release. Ideally, this date should match the data dump file date. Release file generation is often completed 1 or more days before the release is actually deployed. In that case, the planned release date should be used (not the current date).

Last modified dates are updated using a script [update_last_mod.py](https://github.com/ror-community/curation_ops/blob/main/utilities/update_last_mod/update_last_mod.py) triggered by a Github action [Update last modified date](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/actions/workflows/update_last_mod.yml). This action should be run after all other changes to release files are complete.

1. Go to https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/actions/workflows/update_last_mod.yml(Actions > Update last modified date in the ror-updates repository)
2. Click Run workflow at right and set the following options:
    - **Use workflow from:** Branch rc-vX.X
    - **Date value to populate last_modified field with:** Planned release date (YYYY-MM-DD)
    - **Name of parent directory:** Blank, unless files are located in a directory with a different name from the release branch name

3. Click the green Run workflow button. Success/error status will be shown in Github actions and posted to the #ror-curation-releases Slack channel.

## Validate files again in ror-updates
After all record updates above are complete, record files should be validated again to ensure that the changes applied by the script are still schema-valid. During this validation run, relationships and locations should also be validated.

Follow the steps above to run validation, but with Geonames and relationship validation:
f
    - **Use workflow from:** Branch rc-vX.X
    - **Schema version:** v2
    - **Check box to skip Geonames validation:** Unchecked
    - **Check box to validate relationships:** Checked
    - **Name of parent directory:** Blank, unless files are located in a directory with a different name from the release branch name

# Release to Staging

## Create new release branch in ror-records

### Github UI
1. Go to [ror-community/ror-records](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-records)
2. Click the branches dropdown in the upper left (should say 'main' by default)
3. Click staging to switch to the staging branch
4. Click the branches dropdown again (should now say 'staging')
5. Enter the name of your new release branch in the "Find or create branch" field. Names for new release candidate branches should follow the convention v[MAJOR VERSION].[MINOR VERSION].[PATCH VERSION IF APPLICABLE], ex: v1.3.
6. Click Create branch: [NEW BRANCH NAME] from 'staging'

### Git CLI
These steps assume that you have already [installed and configured git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your computer, and that you have cloned the [ror-records](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-records) repository locally.

1. In the ror-records checkout the staging branch

        git checkout staging

2. Make sure your local staging branch matches the remote branch (make sure to git stash any local changes before doing this!)

        git fetch origin
        git reset --hard origin/staging

3. Checkout a new branch based on staging. Names for new release candidate branches should follow the convention v[MAJOR VERSION].[MINOR VERSION].[PATCH VERSION IF APPLICABLE], ex: v1.3.

        git checkout -b v1.3

## Push new/updated ROR JSON files to release branch in ror-records

### Github UI
1. On your computer, place all the JSON files for the new and updated ROR records into a folder with the **exact same name** as the release branch (ex, v1.3).
2. In the ror-records repository, click the Branches dropdown at left and choose the vX.X branch that you created in the previous steps.
3. Click the Add file button at right and choose Upload files
4. Add your folder of files as prompted
5. Under Commit changes, type a commit message in the first text box, leave the radio button set to "Commit directly to the vX.X branch" and click Commit changes.
6. Repeat steps 1-4 if additional files need to be added to the release candidate.

### Git CLI
1. Create in new directory in the root of the ror-records repository the **exact same name** as the release branch (ex, v1.3).

        mkdir v1.3

2. Place JSON files for new and updated records inside the directory you just created. Do not place them in subdirectories. If there are relationships, also include relationships.csv file.
. Add and commit the files

        git add v1.3/
        git commit -m "add new and updated ROR records to release v1.3"

3. Push the files and new branch to the remote ror-records repository

        git push origin v1.3

4. Repeat steps 1-3 if additional files need to be added to the release candidate.

## Validate files in ror-records
Before finalizing a release candidate, JSON files for new and updated ROR records should be validated to check that they comply with the ROR schema and contained properly formatted JSON. Validation is performed by a script [run_validations.py](https://github.com/ror-community/validation-suite/blob/main/run_validations.py) triggered by a Github action [Validate files](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-records/blob/staging/.github/workflows/validate.yml
), which should be run after all new and updated JSON records to be included in the release are uploaded to the vX.X branch.

1. Go to https://github.com/ror-community/ror-records/actions/workflows/validate.yml (Actions > Create relationships in the ror-records repository)
2. Click Run workflow at right and set the following options:
    - **Use workflow from:** Branch vX.X
    - **Schema version:** v2
    - **Check box to skip Geonames validation:** Unchecked
    - **Check box to validate relationships:** Checked
    - **Name of parent directory:** Blank, unless files are located in a directory with a different name from the release branch name

3. Click the green Run workflow button. Success/error status will be shown in Github actions and posted to the #ror-curation-releases Slack channel.
4. If this workflow fails, there's an issue with the data in one of more ROR record JSON files that needs to be corrected. In that case, check the error details, make the needed corrections, commit and push the files to the vX.X branch and repeat steps 1-3 to re-run the Validate files workflow.

**IMPORTANT! Validate files workflow must succeed before proceeding to deployment**

## Deploy v2 to Staging
Deploying v2 to staging.ror.org/search and api.staging.ror.org requires making a Github pull request and merging it. Each of these actions triggers different automated workflows:

- **Open pull request against Staging branch:** Check user permissions and validate files
- **Merge pull request to Staging branch:**  Check user permissions, deploy release candidate to Staging API (v2 only)

v1 must be deployed separately, after data dump is created.

*Note that only specific Github users (ROR staff) are allowed to open/merge pull requests and create releases.*

1. Go to https://github.com/ror-community/ror-records/pulls (Pull requests tab in ror-records repository)
2. Click New pull request at right and set the following options:
    - Base: Staging (Important! Do not make a pull request against the default Main branch)
    - Compare: vX.X branch
3. Click Create pull request and enter ```Merge vX.X to staging``` in the Title field. Leave the Comments field blank.
4. Double-check that the Base dropdown is set to Staging and that the list of updated files appears to be correct, then click Create pull request
5. A Github action [Staging pull request](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-records/blob/staging/.github/workflows/staging_pull_request.yml) will be triggered which (1) verifies that the user is allowed to perform a release to staging and (2) runs the file validation script again. Success/error status will be shown in Github actions and posted to the #ror-curation-releases Slack channel.
6. Once the Staging pull request workflow has completed successfully, click Merge pull request
7. A Github action [Deploy to staging v2 only](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-records/blob/staging/.github/workflows/merge.yml) will be triggered, which pushes the new and updated JSON files from the vX.X directory to AWS S3 and indexes the data into the v2 ROR Elasticsearch index. Success/error status will be shown in Github actions and posted to the #ror-curation-releases Slack channel. The new data should now be available in https://staging.ror.org/search and https://api.staging.ror.org/v2

### Multiple staging releases
If records needed to be added or changed after an initial Staging release, add the new/updated records to the existing release branch per [Push new/updated ROR JSON files to release branch](#push-newupdated-ror-json-files-to-release-branch) and repeat the steps to [Deploy to v2 Staging](#deploy-to-v2-staging). A few points to note with multiple Staging releases:

- Relationship generation/removal, label updates, addresses updates and last modified date udpates may need to be re-run in ror-updates, depending on changes.
- Do not remove records from the release branch that have already been deployed to Staging. Overwrite any records already deployed to Staging that require changes and leave the rest as they are. When ready to deploy to poduction, the release branch should contain all new/updated records to be included in the production release.
- Include relationships for any records already in merged to the vX.X directory on Staging in the release branch relationships.csv (not just the current deployment)
- Deleting record files from the release branch after they have been deployed to Staging will not remove them from the Staging index. At the moment, this will need to be done manually by a developer; in the future, we will add a mechanism to remove records from the Staging index that have been deleted from an release branch. This does not affect production, as the production index is completely separate.

## Test v2 Staging release

### New records
Choose several new records from the Staging release and, for each record:
1. Check that the record can be retrieved from the Staging API

        curl https://api.staging.ror.org/v2/organizations/[RORID]

2. Check that the record can be searched by name in the Staging API (make sure to [escape spaces and reserved characters](https://ror.readme.io/docs/rest-api#reserved-characters))

          curl https://api.staging.ror.org/v2/organizations?query=[STAGING%20RECORD%20NAME]

3. Check that the record can be searched by name in the Staging UI and the results are as expected.

        https://staging.ror.org/search > Enter name in search box

### Updated records
Choose several updated records from the Staging release and, for each record:

1. Check that the record can be retrieved from the v2 Staging API

        curl https://api.staging.ror.org/v2/organizations/[RORID]

2. Check that the record can be searched by name in the v2 Staging API (make sure to [escape spaces and reserved characters](https://ror.readme.io/docs/rest-api#reserved-characters))

          curl https://api.staging.ror.org/v2/organizations?query=[RECORD%20NAME]

3. Retrieve the record from the v2 Staging API and the v2 Production API and compare changes to verify that the expected changes where made.

        curl https://api.staging.ror.org/v2/organizations/[ROR ID] > staging_[RORID].json
        curl https://api.ror.org/v2/organizations/[ROR ID] > prod_[RORID].json
        diff staging_[RORID].json prod_[RORID].json

4. Check that the record can be searched by name in the Staging UI and the results are as expected.

        https://staging.ror.org/search > Enter name in search box

### Unchanged records
Choose several records from Production that were not included in the release and for each record:

1. Retrieve the record from the v2 Staging API and the v2 Production API and compare changes to verify that the records are identical.

        curl https://api.staging.ror.org/organizations/[ROR ID] > staging_[RORID].json
        curl https://api.ror.org/v2/organizations/[ROR ID] > prod_[RORID].json
        diff staging_[RORID].json prod_[RORID].json

```diff``` result should be nothing (no response).

## Create data dump
A data dump must be created in order to index v1. To create a data dump with records in both v2 and v1:

1. In the ror-records repository, go to [Actions > Create data dump](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-records/actions/workflows/generate_dump.yml)
2. Click Run workflow at right and set the following options:
    - **Use workflow from:** Branch Staging (Main is also OK - doesn't matter)
    - **Schema version:** v2
    - **Name of the directory that the new release is located in:** vX.X
    - **Check box to validate relationships:** Checked
    - **Name of the existing release zip file to base this data dump from:** Name of the last production data dump from ror-data that the new dump should be built from, ex 2021-09-23-ror-data (without the .zip file extension)

3. Click the green Run workflow button. Success/error status will be shown in Github actions and posted to the #ror-curation-releases Slack channel.

## Test data dump
TODO: add info about running data dump tests

## Deploy v1 to Staging
v1 deployment to api.staging.ror.org is done via a full reindex from a data dump. This means that a data dump must be generated in ror-data before v1 can be indexed.

1. Go to https://github.com/ror-community/ror-records/actions/workflows/staging_index_dump.yml (Actions > STAGING index full data dump in the ror-records repository)
2. Click Run workflow at right and set the following options:
    - **Use workflow from:** Branch Staging (will fail if any other branch selected)
    - **Name of existing release dump file to index:** Name of the dump file to index, ex 2021-09-23-ror-data (without the .zip file extension). Must exist in ror-data.
    - **Schema version to index:** v1
    - **ROR data env:** prod (uses dump from ror-data)

3. Click the green Run workflow button. Success/error status will be shown in Github actions and posted to the #ror-curation-releases Slack channel.
4. If this workflow fails, most likely there was a timeout in the API server. In this case, the file was likely successfully indexed; the server connection just timed out before indexing completed. Check https://api.staging.ror.org/v1/organizations to see whether the dump was indexed.

## Test v1 Staging release
Perform API tests above, using v1 base URL https://api.staging.ror.org/v1/organizations . v1 is not available in the UI.

# Release to production

## Deploy v2 to Production
Deploying v2 to ror.org/search and api.ror.org requires making a Github pull request and merging it, then tagging and publishing a new release. Each of these actions triggers different automated workflows:

- **Open pull request against Main branch:** Check user permissions
- **Merge pull request to Main branch:**  No action (approval required to merge, though)
- **Publish release:** Check user permissions, copy files to S3, index v2 release to production API

*Note that only specific Github users (ROR staff) are allowed to open/merge pull requests and create releases.*

5. A Github action Production pull request will be triggered, which checks that the user has permission to open a pull request.
6. Once the Production pull request workflow has completed successfully, request approval from another ROR team member in Slack. At least one approval is required before merging the pull request.
7. After the pull request has been approved, click Merge pull request.
8. Go to https://github.com/ror-community/ror-records/releases (Release tab in ror-records repository)
9. Click Draft new release at right
10. Click the Choose a tag dropdown and enter the version number for the release, ex v1.3. This should be the same number as the release branch and the directory that the release files are located in. Click Create new tag X.X on publish.
11. In the Release name field, enter ```vX.X``` (replace X.X with the release tag number)
12. In the Dsecribe this release field, enter ```Includes updates listed in https://github.com/ror-community/ror-records/milestone/X``` (link to correct milestone for this release)
13. Click Publish release
14. A Github action [Deploy to prod v2 only](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-records/actions/workflows/main_release.yml) will be triggered, which pushes the new and updated JSON files to AWS S3, indexes the data into the production v2 ROR Elasticsearch index. Success/error status will be shown in Github actions and posted to the #ror-curation-releases Slack channel. The new data should now be available in https://ror.org/search and https://api.ror.org/v2/organizations

## Test v2 Production release

Choose several new, updated and unchanged records and, for each record:

1. Check that the record can be retrieved from the Production API and the results are as expected.

        curl https://api.ror.org/v2/organizations/[RORID]

2. Check that the record can be retrieved from the Production API and the results are as expected.

        https://ror.org/[RORID]

3. Check that the record can be searched by name in the Production API (make sure to [escape spaces and reserved characters](https://ror.readme.io/docs/rest-api#reserved-characters)) and the results are as expected.

          curl https://api.ror.org/v2/organizations?query=[STAGING%20RECORD%20NAME]

4. Check that the record can be searched by name in the Production UI and the results are as expected.

        https://ror.org/search > Enter name in search box

## Deploy v1 to Production

v1 deployment to api.ror.org is done via a full reindex from a data dump. This means that a data dump must be generated in ror-data before v1 can be indexed.

1. Go to https://github.com/ror-community/ror-records/actions/workflows/prod_index_dump.yml (Actions > PROD index full data dump in the ror-records repository)
2. Click Run workflow at right and set the following options:
    - **Use workflow from:** Branch Main (will fail if any other branch selected)
    - **Name of existing release dump file to index:** Name of the dump file to index, ex 2021-09-23-ror-data (without the .zip file extension). Must exist in ror-data.
    - **Schema version to index:** v1
    - **ROR data env:** prod (uses dump from ror-data)

3. Click the green Run workflow button. Success/error status will be shown in Github actions and posted to the #ror-curation-releases Slack channel.
4. If this workflow fails, most likely there was a timeout in the API server. In this case, the file was likely successfully indexed; the server connection just timed out before indexing completed. Check https://api.ror.org/v1/organizations to see whether the dump was indexed.

## Test v1 Production release
Perform API tests above, using v1 base URL https://api.ror.org/v1/organizations . v1 is not available in the UI.

# Publish public data dump

## Generate release in ror-updates Github
1. Create a new release in ror-updates that corresponds to the version number of the release
2. Add information in the release notes about the records that have been added and updated. To generate correct Zenodo upload description text, counts of records in release notes must be formatted like:

```
- **Total organizations**: 104,402
- **Records added**: 62
- **Records updated**: 257
```

## Publish public data dump to Zenodo
**IMPORTANT! Data dump must be created in ror-data AND release must be created in ror-updates before publishing the dump to Zenodo!**
The script that publishes the dump to Zenodo uses the zip file from ror-data and information from the Github release notes to create a new version in Zenodo.

1. In the ror-records repository, go to [Actions > Publish data dump to Zenodo](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-records/actions/workflows/publish_dump_zenodo.yml)
2. Click Run workflow at right and set the following options:
    - **Use workflow from:** Branch Main
    - **Release version:** vX.X
    - **Zenodo environment:** Prod
    - **Parent Zenodo record ID:** 6347575

3. Click the green Run workflow button. Success/error status will be shown in Github actions and posted to the #ror-curation-releases Slack channel.communities/ror-data. The DOI of the new upload will be shown in the "execute script" step of the Action run output in Github.

## Announce production release
Announce the production release on the following channels:
- Community channel in ROR Slack
- Twitter
- Github discussions ("announcements" category)
- PID Forum
- API Users' Group

## Clean up ror-updates Github
1. Close the release milestone
2. Close the issues in the milestone
3. Move the issues in the milestone to the "Done" column on the project board

# Misc
## Manual deployment v2 only

**This process can only be used for v2. To deploy (or re-deploy) v1, follow the deploy v1 steps above to deploy from a data dump.**

Occasionally, a 504 Gateway Timeout happens while indexing files into AWS ElasticSearch during automated v2 staging or production deployment. This will cause the automatic Deploy to Staging (on PR merge) or Deploy to Prod (on release) actions to fail at the Index file step.

In this case, you can re-run the deployment action manually:

1. In the ror-records repository, go to [Actions > Manual deploy to Staging](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-records/actions/workflows/staging_manual_index.yml) or [Actions > Manual deploy to Prod](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-records/actions/workflows/prod_manual_index.yml), depending on which environment you need to deploy to.
2. Click Run workflow at right and set the following options:
    - **Use workflow from:** Main branch when deploying to production or the staging branch when deploying to staging.
    - **Schema version to index:** v2
    - **Name of the release tag that you would like to deploy (prod) OR Name of the directory you would like to deploy (staging):** vX.X

3. Click the Run workflow button. If sucessful, a green checkbox will be shown in the Actions history, and a success messages will be posted to the #ror-curation-releases Slack channel.
